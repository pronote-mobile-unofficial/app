## PRONOTE.NET

There are two Pronote clients: Client Pronote, and PRONOTE.NET.

We base our researches on PRONOTE.NET, which is the web-based client, even if
we found interesting things about that.

## CAS

CAS means *«Central Authentication Service»*. It allow PRONOTE login
from the ENT without credential if the school has an [ENT](#ent).

## ENT

An ENT, *Éspace Numérique de Travail*, is a set of tools available to students,
which pronote may be a part of.

## iv
Init Vector. This is a component used in AES-CBC encryption/decryption.

## AES-CBC

Pronote uses a subset of AES encryption, which is AES-CBC.
AES-CBC not only requires a key, but also requires an init
vector. (see *[iv](#iv)*)
