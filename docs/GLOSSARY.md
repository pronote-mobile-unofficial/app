## PRONOTE.NET

Pronote is split into two parts: Client Pronote, and PRONOTE.NET.
We base our researches on PRONOTE.NET, which is the web-based client.

## iv
Init Vector. This is a component used in AES-CBC encryption/decryption.

## forge

Forge is an encryption library used by the PRONOTE.NET client.
Please see [here](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) for more informations

## AES-CBC

Pronote uses a subset of AES encryption, which is AES-CBC.
AES-CBC not only requires a key, but also requires an init
vector. (see *[iv](#iv)*)
